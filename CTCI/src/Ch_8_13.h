/*
	Stack of Boxes :		You have a stack of n boxes, with width w1, height h1 and depth d1. The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be
						stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height,
						and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the 
						sum pf the heights of each box.
